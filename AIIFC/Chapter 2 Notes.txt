COBIT - Control Objectives for Information and related Technology, Useful for for internal auditors irrespective of regulatory compulsions

ITGI - IT Governance Institute, Issue and update COBIT, Focused on research and governance

ISACA - Information Systems Audit and Control Association, Focused on IT auditing, Certifications: CISA, CISM

COBIT IT governance focus areas - Strategic alignment, Value delivery, Risk management, Resource management, Performance measurement

COBIT framework - More emphasis on IT than COSO

Basic COBIT Principles - Cyclic/continuous -> Business requirements drive the investments in IT reources that are used by IT processes to deliver Enterprise information which responds to Business requirements

COBIT Cube - 3 IT dimensions: IT Resources, IT Processes and Business Requirements

IT resources - Applications, Information, Infrastructure, People

IT processes - Domains (groupings of IT activities that match to organizational areas of responsibilities), Processes (series of joined activities with natural control breaks), Activities (actions needed to achieve measurable results)

Domains - Planning and enterprise (Planning process steps), Acquisition and implementation, Delivery and support, Monitoring and evaluation

Business requirements - Effectiveness, Efficiency, Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Compliance, Reliability

Using COBIT to assess internal controls - IT processes to be evaluated though 5 navigation steps, Either top-down approach or bottom-up approach

Business requirements marked with P (primary) or S (secondary) or left blank (if not applicable or not necessary)

IT resource areas checked if applicable

Pentagon diagram areas shaded/marked if primary or secondary

Planning and enterprise - 10 high-level Planning and Organization (PO) control objectives, Each PO expanded into more detailed objectives,

 RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) charts for identifying roles and responsibilties related to each COBIT objective

Acquisition and implementation - 7 AI objectives, AI6 objectives follow 5-step process for managing changes

Delivery and support - 13 DS objectives
Goals and metricss scenarios to fill Exhibit 2.6: DS10 manage problems goals and metrics

Monitoring and evaluation (ME) - Never-ending closed-loop process, Quality assurance, 4 principal control objectives, 7 supporting objectives




Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA) cycle (Edward Deming) - Measured by Number of internal control breaches, Number of control improvement initiatives, Number and coverage of control self-assessments (ongoing internal reviews)

Using COBIT in SOX environment - For implementing section 404 due to high focus on IT-oriented controls

Cubic relationship between COBIT and COSO - Y-axis: COSO internal control components, X-axis: COBIT objectives, Z-axis: SOX Sections 404 & 302
Tabular relationship between COSO and COBIT

Information Technology Assurance Framework (ITAF) - COBIT assurance guidance, Objective is to define standards which ensure quality, consistency and reliability of IT assessments based on good practices
